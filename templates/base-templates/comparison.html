                        A team's season outcome can be directly related to their payroll. In the past few
                        seasons (excluding the 2020 season), 45 out of 54 teams who made it into postseason
                        contention or farther typically had a payroll of at least $90,000,000. Teams that
                        made it to the World Series typically had a payroll of at least $110,000,000. However,
                        this is not always true for all teams as there are many teams with payrolls above
                        $90,000,000 that were eliminated from postseason contention. There are 28 teams that
                        had a payroll of at least $150,000,000 that were eliminated from postseason contention.
                        This could be due to other factors not considered such as trades and injuries.

                    <td>
                        The amount of wins that a team gets during a season can be directly related to their
                        payroll. In the past few seasons (excluding the 2020 season), 55 out of 63 teams with
                        85 wins or more typically had a payroll of at least $75,000,000. 19 out of 27 teams
                        with 95 wins or more typically had a payroll of at least $100,000,000. There are several
                        teams who have payrolls above $75,000,000 that had less than 85 wins in a season that
                        could be due to other factors such as trades and injuries.
